## API Security

### Overview

Security is a critical component of the AirBnB Clone backend, protecting sensitive user data, financial transactions, and platform integrity. The following key security measures are implemented across the system to create a robust defense against threats and vulnerabilities.

### 1. Authentication

**Implementation**: Token-Based Authentication (JWT)
- Users authenticate with email and password credentials
- Upon successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued containing user identity and permissions
- JWT tokens are included in request headers (Authorization: Bearer <token>) for subsequent API calls
- Tokens expire after a configured duration, requiring re-authentication for enhanced security
- Refresh tokens enable users to obtain new access tokens without re-entering credentials

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Prevents Unauthorized Access**: Only authenticated users can access protected resources and their data
- **Enables User Identification**: Tracks which user performed specific actions for audit and accountability purposes
- **Protects Sensitive Operations**: Authentication is mandatory before users can create bookings, make payments, or access personal information
- **Complies with Security Standards**: JWT-based authentication is industry-standard and widely recognized as secure

### 2. Authorization & Access Control

**Implementation**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Users are assigned roles: Guest, Host, or Admin, each with specific permissions
- Endpoint-level authorization checks verify user permissions before processing requests
- Guests cannot modify properties or access other guests' bookings
- Hosts can only manage their own properties and view bookings for those properties
- Admin role has elevated permissions for platform management and oversight

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data and resources appropriate to their role
- **Prevents Privilege Escalation**: Authorization checks prevent unauthorized users from performing privileged operations
- **Protects Property Management**: Hosts cannot modify other hosts' listings or access their revenue data
- **Ensures Business Logic Compliance**: Authorization enforces the business rules of the platform

### 3. Password Security

**Implementation**: Cryptographic Hashing
- User passwords are never stored in plain text in the database
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt, making them resistant to brute-force attacks
- Password strength requirements are enforced (minimum length, complexity)
- Users cannot reuse recently used passwords
- Failed login attempts are tracked to detect and prevent brute-force attacks

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Protects User Accounts**: Even if the database is compromised, passwords remain secure due to hashing
- **Prevents Account Takeover**: Strong password policies and cryptographic hashing make accounts difficult to breach
- **Compliance with Standards**: Password security measures align with OWASP and industry best practices
- **Maintains User Trust**: Users can be confident that their credentials are securely protected

### 4. Rate Limiting

**Implementation**: API Request Throttling
- Rate limits are enforced per user or IP address (e.g., 100 requests per hour)
- Requests exceeding the limit receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response
- Different endpoints may have different rate limits based on resource consumption
- Temporary bans are applied after multiple rate limit violations
- Admin users may have higher rate limits or exemptions

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Prevents Abuse**: Rate limiting prevents malicious users from overwhelming the API with requests
- **Protects Against DoS Attacks**: Distributed denial-of-service attacks are mitigated through request throttling
- **Ensures Fair Resource Usage**: Rate limits prevent individual users from monopolizing server resources
- **Maintains Service Availability**: By preventing abuse, rate limiting ensures the service remains available for legitimate users

### 5. HTTPS/TLS Encryption

**Implementation**: Transport Layer Security
- All API communications occur over HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher
- SSL/TLS certificates are obtained and maintained for the production domain
- HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options) are configured to enforce secure communication
- Certificate pinning may be implemented for mobile clients to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Protects Data in Transit**: HTTPS encryption prevents interception of sensitive data like passwords and payment information
- **Prevents Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: TLS ensures that data cannot be intercepted or modified during transmission
- **Builds User Confidence**: HTTPS certificates signal to users that the platform is secure
- **Complies with Payment Standards**: PCI-DSS and other standards require HTTPS for handling financial data

### 6. Payment Security

**Implementation**: PCI-DSS Compliance & Payment Gateway Integration
- Payment processing is delegated to trusted payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
- Credit card information is never stored or processed directly by the backend
- Payment data is tokenized, storing only secure tokens instead of raw card details
- Transactions are encrypted and validated before processing
- Fraud detection systems monitor suspicious transaction patterns

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Protects Financial Data**: Delegation to payment gateways ensures credit card data is handled by PCI-DSS certified services
- **Prevents Fraud**: Tokenization and fraud detection protect against unauthorized transactions
- **Ensures Legal Compliance**: PCI-DSS compliance is mandatory for any platform processing credit card payments
- **Builds Payment Confidence**: Users trust their payment information is secure when handled by reputable gateways

### 7. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Implementation**: Server-Side Data Validation
- All user inputs are validated on the server side before processing
- Input length limits prevent buffer overflow attacks
- Special characters and potentially malicious code are sanitized or rejected
- Data type validation ensures inputs match expected formats (e.g., dates, numbers)
- SQL injection attacks are prevented through parameterized queries and ORM usage

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Prevents Injection Attacks**: Input validation prevents SQL injection and other code injection attacks
- **Maintains Data Integrity**: Validation ensures only valid data is stored in the database
- **Protects Against XSS**: Sanitization prevents cross-site scripting attacks through stored or reflected XSS
- **Ensures Application Stability**: Validation prevents malformed data from causing application errors

### 8. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**Implementation**: Strict CORS Policies
- CORS headers are configured to allow requests only from authorized frontend domains
- Credentials and sensitive headers are protected through proper CORS configuration
- Preflight requests are validated before allowing cross-origin requests
- CORS misconfiguration is prevented through explicit whitelisting of allowed origins

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Prevents Unauthorized Frontend Access**: CORS policies prevent malicious websites from making requests to the API
- **Protects Against CSRF Attacks**: Proper CORS configuration is part of CSRF defense mechanisms
- **Enables Secure Frontend Communication**: Authorized frontends can communicate securely with the API
- **Controls API Access**: CORS policies act as a first line of defense against unauthorized API usage

### 9. Logging & Monitoring

**Implementation**: Comprehensive Security Logging
- All authentication attempts (successful and failed) are logged with timestamps
- API access logs record user identity, endpoints accessed, and response codes
- Security events (authorization failures, rate limit violations) are logged and monitored
- Logs are stored securely and retained for audit purposes
- Real-time alerts notify administrators of suspicious activities or security incidents

**Why It's Crucial**:
- **Enables Incident Detection**: Logging helps identify security breaches, unauthorized access, or suspicious patterns
- **Supports Forensic Analysis**: Detailed logs enable investigation of security incidents and identification of root causes
- **Ensures Accountability**: Logs track user actions for compliance and audit purposes

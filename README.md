# AirBnB Clone - Backend Project

## Project Overview

The backend for the AirBnB Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals

- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Features Overview

### 1. API Documentation
- **OpenAPI Standard**: APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard for clarity and ease of integration
- **Django REST Framework**: Comprehensive RESTful API for CRUD operations
- **GraphQL**: Flexible and efficient query mechanism

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints**: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
- **Features**: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints**: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints**: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features**: Make, update, and manage bookings with check-in/check-out details

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints**: `/payments/`
- **Features**: Handle payment transactions related to bookings

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints**: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
- **Features**: Post and manage reviews for properties

### 7. Database Optimizations
- **Indexing**: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data
- **Caching**: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance
